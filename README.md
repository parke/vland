# `vland` - a virtual userland manager

##  Notice: As of 2023 `vland` is obsolete.

As of October 2023, `vland` is both out-of-date and obsolete.  (Actually, `vland` has been obsolete for some time now.)  Most of `vland`'s functionality was either (a) moved into Lxroot itself, or (b) moved into single-purpose, stand-alone Bash scripts.  These Bash scripts are published in the Lxroot repository.
